# Spectator Randomats
Automatically triggers randomats that will help players locate each other to end the round faster. These randomats trigger once there are as many or fewer players left in the round than the configurable minimum. This minimum does not include jester team roles in its count. The first randomat will trigger after a configurable number of seconds and the second will trigger a configurable number of seconds after the first.
